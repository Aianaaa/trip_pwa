    ```bash

- **Manifest File**: The app includes a manifest file, which defines metadata like name, icons, theme color, and start URL, allowing users to install the app to their home screen.
- **Offline Mode**: When the user has no internet connection, the app provides limited offline functionality, notifying the user that they are offline and offering offline features.

2. **About Page**: Information about specific tours, including images and descriptions.
3. **Contact Page**: Allows users to book tours and manage their reservations.

## Caching Strategy
The app uses an appropriate caching strategy for different types of resources, including:
- Static resources (images, CSS, JS files) are cached for faster load times.

## Deployment
